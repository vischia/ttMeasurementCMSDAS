In the current exercise you will use two tools for statistical analysis that are of common usage in High Energy Physics.
The objective of the current exercise is to learn how to measure the production cross section of top quark pairs at sqrt(s)=5TeV; the cross section is the *observable* (the physical quantity) that we want to determine from our data obtaining a *measurement*, e.g. stating that the cross section is XXX (*value*) +/- YYY (*uncertainty*) pb. The same problem is referred to in statistics as *parameter estimation*; the cross section is the *parameter*, which in nature has a specific value (or range of values), the *true value*. We obtain an *estimate* of the parameter when we quote a certain value (*point estimate*) and a range of values around it (*interval*).

## References on statistical methods

A good overview of statistics at the LHC can be found in [Practical Statistics for the LHC by Kyle Cranmer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07622), whereas a more complete treatment of the statistics commonly used at the LHC can be found in the nice [Statistical Methods for Experimental Physics by Fred James](https://www.amazon.com/Statistical-Methods-Experimental-Physics-2Nd/dp/9812705279). Both references are from particle physicists, so the language should not be too obscure. If you are interested in the statisticians' take on the topic---which I recommend---you can read the very nice book [Statistical Inference by Casella and Berger](https://www.amazon.fr/Statistical-Inference-George-Casella/dp/0495391875/). In the current exercise, you will be measuring the cross section in different final states, and then obtain an individual estimate for the cross section by either combining together the individual measurements or by measuring the cross section simultaneously in both final states; you can find a nice overview of the problem of combinining individual measurements in this [note by Louis Lyons and Ã‰milien Chapon](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05540)


## Available tools

* **BLUE**, the **B**est **L**inear **U**nbiased **E**stimator, in the implementation by Andrea Giammanco (see below)
   - Based on [an article by Louis Lyons](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0168900288900186)
   - Iterative extension based on [an article by Luca Lista](https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3425)
   - You can use [a simple implementation by Andrea Giammanco](http://agiamman.web.cern.ch/agiamman/blue/)
   - In case you need a full-fledged tool, check out the [hepforge BLUE package by Richard Nisius](https://blue.hepforge.org/)

* **Combine**, the Higgs combination tool, developed within CMS originally as a framework for the discovery of the Higgs boson. Now it has been extended to multiple use cases, and is used in many CMS analyses. You will definitely have to use it in your everyday (work) life. The documentation of the package [is pretty good](https://github.com/cms-analysis/HiggsAnalysis-CombinedLimit/wiki), but be warned that nothing substitutes [looking into the source code](https://github.com/cms-analysis/HiggsAnalysis-CombinedLimit) to understand exactly what each option does, when in doubt. A quick look at [the procedures developed for the ATLAS+CMS Higgs boson combination](https://cds.cern.ch/record/1379837) can give you an idea of the connection between the material contained in the software and its mathematical formulation.
